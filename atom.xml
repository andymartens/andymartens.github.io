    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How are the emotions we experience in dreams different than the emotions we experience during real life events?</p>

<p>We can get some clues about this by analyzing a publicly available dataset. 185 people each described two dreams and two real life events. That&rsquo;s <a href="http://sleepanddreamdatabase.org/dream/search?searchtoggle=1&amp;searchtab=0&amp;urlenv=%7B%7D&amp;incl=%7B%22kahan_q2%22%3A+1%2C+%22kahan_q1%22%3A+1%7D&amp;searchconstraint=%7B%7D&amp;searchquery=&amp;minwords=&amp;maxwords=&amp;onlyperson=">370 dreams</a> and <a href="http://sleepanddreamdatabase.org/dream/search?searchtoggle=1&amp;searchtab=0&amp;urlenv=%7B%7D&amp;incl=%7B%22kahan_q3%22%3A+1%2C+%22kahan_q4%22%3A+1%7D&amp;searchconstraint=%7B%7D&amp;searchquery=&amp;minwords=&amp;maxwords=&amp;onlyperson=">370 real life events</a> for analysis.</p>

<p>Analyzing these data first entailed constructing a dictionary of <a href="https://github.com/andymartens/fletcher/blob/master/emotion_words.txt">589 emotion-related words-groups</a>. These word-groups consisted of all variants on the same underlying emotion (e.g., joy, joyful, joyfully, joyous, joyously, joys, joyed). Then I computed and graphed <a href="https://github.com/andymartens/fletcher/blob/master/dreams_ratio_formula.txt">Bayesian estimates</a> that gauged the likelihood of each of these emotion-groups occurring in dreams as compared to real life. The graph on the left shows emotions more likely in dreams. For example, &ldquo;scared&rdquo; is about three times as likely to show up in a dream than in a real event. The graph on the right shows emotions more likely in real experiences.</p>

<p>The colors provide an overall sense of how the emotional content of dreams and real experiences differ. Red reflects negative emotions and green reflects positive emotions. The brighter the red or the green, the more intense the emotion. Incorporating emotional intensity was made possible by using <a href="link">existing ratings</a> collected in prior research.</p>

<p>By comparing the overall color schemes of the graphs, it&rsquo;s clear that people use more negative emotions in descriptions of dreams than real events. The negative emotions more common in dreams also appear to be particularly intense&mdash;the reds tend to be brighter in the dream graph on the left. This pattern for dreams to have more negative emotional content than descriptions of waking life is consistent with <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.890/abstract">other research</a>.</p>

<p>What does this mean? It&rsquo;s conceivable that these differences can tell us about the unconscious&mdash;about the emotions
that are buried beneath the surface during the day but that have an opportunity to express themselves during sleep while people&rsquo;s defenses and inhibitions are relaxed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How are the emotions we typically experience in dreams different than the emotions we typically experience during real-life events?</p>

<p>We can get some clues about this using a publicly available dataset. Tracey Kahan at Santa Clara University asked 185 undergraduates to each describe two dreams and two real-life events. That&rsquo;s about <a href="http://sleepanddreamdatabase.org/dream/search?searchtoggle=1&amp;searchtab=0&amp;urlenv=%7B%7D&amp;incl=%7B%22kahan_q2%22%3A+1%2C+%22kahan_q1%22%3A+1%7D&amp;searchconstraint=%7B%7D&amp;searchquery=&amp;minwords=&amp;maxwords=&amp;onlyperson=">370 dreams</a> and about <a href="http://sleepanddreamdatabase.org/dream/search?searchtoggle=1&amp;searchtab=0&amp;urlenv=%7B%7D&amp;incl=%7B%22kahan_q3%22%3A+1%2C+%22kahan_q4%22%3A+1%7D&amp;searchconstraint=%7B%7D&amp;searchquery=&amp;minwords=&amp;maxwords=&amp;onlyperson=">370 real-life events</a> to analyze.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of ways we might analyze these data. Here&rsquo;s what I did, in short. I pieced together a big list of <a href="https://github.com/andymartens/fletcher/blob/master/emotion_words.txt">581 emotion-related words</a>. Then I <a href="https://github.com/andymartens/fletcher/blob/master/emotion_dream_analysis_code.py">examined</a> how often these words show up in people&rsquo;s descriptions of their dreams relative to descriptions of their real-life experiences.</p>

<p>The graph below shows the emotions appearing more in dream descriptions than real life descriptions. The higher the bar, the more <a href="https://github.com/andymartens/fletcher/blob/master/dreams_ratio_formula.txt">&ldquo;dream-represenetative&rdquo;</a> the word.</p>

<p><img src="http://andymartens.github.io/images/dreams_to_real.png" title="[width] [height] [Emotion-words Most Representative of Dreams [alt text]]" ></p>

<p>We can also plot the reverse&mdash;the emotions appearing more in descriptions of real life than dreams.</p>

<p><img src="http://andymartens.github.io/images/real_to_dreams.png" title="[width] [height] [Emotion-words Most Representative of Real Life [alt text]]" ></p>

<p>Most apparent from these results, people used more negative emotion-words in their descriptions of dreams relative to real life events. Almost all of the dream-representative emotions are negative. Whereas only about 50% of the real life emotions are negative. This pattern for dreams to have darker and more negative emotional content than descriptions of waking life is consistent with <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.890/abstract">other research</a>. It may also be worth thinking about whether the negative emotions in the dream graph vs. the real-life graph are somehow of a different type.</p>

<p>What do these graphs mean? Who knows. But it&rsquo;s conceivable that the differences
we see between the two graphs can tell us about the unconscious&mdash;about the emotions
that are buried beneath the surface during the day but that have an opportunity to express themselves during sleep while people&rsquo;s defenses and inhibitions are relaxed.</p>

<!-- One difficulty here is that we don't know from this analysis whether the emotion-words pertain to the emotional state of the person writing the description or to some other person. A description that contains the emotion "angry" may contain the sentence "I am angry" or "I made him angry." In a future analysis we can attempt to distinguish between these two types of emotional expression. -->
